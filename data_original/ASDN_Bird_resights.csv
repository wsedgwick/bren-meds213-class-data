The following day, 27 June was very hot, and an egg hatched; the chick was observed wet and unbrooded in the eveing.  28 June, the chick was dead in the nest, which contained the other two unhatched eggs plus the two SESA eggs and the egg fragments from the dead chick.  Put it together and I think one chick made it out of the nest and the second chick to hatch only hatched because it was about to anyway and it was a hot day out...so got lucky and then unlucky real quick.
